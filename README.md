# pygames
This repository was created to save the development of games made from lessons of freeCodeCamp course "Learn Python by Building 5 Games"

The codes were developed by the respective teacher of each tutorial and I did some changes to run better the games on my machine. 

Anyone is free to do the necessary modifications to adapt these games to yourself.

# The Games

- Pong 
- Snake

# Important information
These games were developed in a Linux system, so users of MAC or Windows will have some bugs if they run these games on yours machines. 

Sorry for that.
